## Data Story & Data Story Contextual Progress Report

### Overview

In data, we can find stories. In this project you will tell one of them.

The first step is to **identify one or several datasets** you want to work with. Next, you need to get **deeply familiar with the context of it**; you need to know, for example, what it is about, and what it is not about, who created it, and why it is accessible to you. You also need to have a hunch about what it is that you intend to show, is there a a literal story in the data? A “thread" that you can color “red” through visualization? Or is there a contrast you aim to highlight, a juxtaposition of two perspectives? The research and the ideas you develop will be the central element of you Contextual Report & Presentation, a milestone that you should treat as a project in itself.

The second part requires your visual design and code proficiency: A website that tells a story that emerges from and is told alongside a dataset (or several).

### The Data

The dataset(s) you choose is the foundation for this project. You can find datasets that exist already online, or create your own one by collecting data manually or scraping it from the web (I can advise). It is most important that you take time for the process of deciding on a dataset.

Some advice: you will be working with this dataset (and related subject matter) for almost 7 weeks - pick something that you don’t get bored of. Your data story is NOT expected to make a discovery and reveal something never seen or suspected before - what matters is your passion for the subject as well as the potential for creative visualizations of it.

### The Data Story Contextual Progress Report & Presentation (Week 10)

The Data Story Contextual Progress Report is a short piece of writing. It should contain 500-700 words and address questions laid out in [this structure](../contextual-report-guide). The structure is a guide, but not every point might apply to your research; try not to stick to it mechanically, but express yourself in your own style instead. Your text should be concise and well-articulated. Please ask at least one friend to proof-read it before you hand it in.

Along with your writing, you are expected to present your research in a 5 minute presentation - the structure of the presentation should be oriented by your writing and use slides to support (but not echo) your words.

**Both is due on April 13th.**


### The Data Story (Week 14)

The Data Story is a webpage that includes at least two interactive data visualizations as well as contextual information (mainly taken from your Contextual Progress Report).

**This is due on May 11th.**
